### üìù Notes:
- **Turn-based Multiplayer**: The system cycles through players, allowing each to contribute to the story sequentially.
- **Context Retention**: The AI remembers previous events and choices to maintain continuity.
- **VIT-Themed Stories**: Stories are set in VIT, incorporating campus culture, rules, and references.
